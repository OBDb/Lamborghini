## About Lamborghini

Automobili Lamborghini is an Italian luxury sports car and SUV manufacturer established in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini. Originally founded to compete with established brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini has become synonymous with extreme performance, distinctive styling, and technological innovation.

## Generations

### Founding Era (1963-1972)

The company was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini, a successful tractor manufacturer who decided to create high-performance grand touring cars after a disagreement with Enzo Ferrari. The first production Lamborghini, the 350 GT, was launched in 1964. This era established Lamborghini's reputation with revolutionary models like the Miura (1966), widely considered the world's first supercar with its mid-engine layout, and the stunning Espada four-seater.

### Countach Era (1973-1990)

Following financial difficulties and the oil crisis, Lamborghini entered a tumultuous period with changing ownership. However, this era produced the iconic Countach, which defined supercar design for a generation with its dramatic wedge shape and scissor doors. The Countach remained in production for an impressive 16 years and established many design elements that would become Lamborghini hallmarks.

### Chrysler to Audi Era (1987-1998)

After acquisition by the Chrysler Corporation in 1987 and later by various investment groups, Lamborghini developed the Diablo as the Countach successor. The Diablo continued the tradition of extreme styling while incorporating modern technology and improved build quality. This transitional period ended with Lamborghini's acquisition by Audi AG (Volkswagen Group) in 1998, bringing much-needed stability.

### Modern Era (1998-Present)

Under Audi/Volkswagen ownership, Lamborghini experienced unprecedented growth and development. Key models include the Murciélago (2001-2010), Gallardo (2003-2013), Aventador (2011-2022), and Huracán (2014-present). The company expanded into new segments with the introduction of the Urus SUV in 2018, which has become Lamborghini's best-selling model. Recent developments include the introduction of hybrid technology, with the Revuelto as the brand's first plug-in hybrid supercar replacing the Aventador.
